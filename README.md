# Mandi-Price-Predictor

The demand for e-market in agriculture is increasing YoY. With it, there is considerable interest in automation of trading and farming. 

In the developing countries like India, there are no standardized rules for prices/rates for which traders are always at a gain than farmers. For the benefit of farmers, government institutions, and other policy makers we attempt to build a system by taking various factors like rainfall, past mandi pricing, the cost of cultivation to predict the mandi price. A strict and stringent reform policies can be implemented by the policy makers which benefits the farmers in the country. 

 An idea to develop a mobile application which will help both farmers and traders get a price prediction of various crop groups in their local markets. The app will be powered by an API which will continuously be feed by the Mandi price market data, rainfall data and the cost of cultivation data.
